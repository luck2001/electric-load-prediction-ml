Project Summary:

This machine learning project predicts electricity demand using historical data and time-based features. By applying data preprocessing, EDA, the system identifies consumption patterns and provides accurate demand forecasts to support efficient energy planning.


⦁	Project Overview

Electricity demand varies significantly based on time, weather, and human activity patterns. Power utilities must accurately forecast demand to avoid underproduction (blackouts) or overproduction (wastage and higher costs).In this project, a supervised machine learning approach is used to predict electricity demand using historical data such as hour of day, day of week, week of year, quarter, and weekend indicators.


⦁	Problem Statement

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts electricity demand based on historical and time-related features.


⦁	Key Objectives:

Analyze historical electricity demand data.
Identify important temporal patterns and trends.
Train and evaluate a regression model for demand prediction.
Minimize prediction error using appropriate evaluation metrics.

⦁	Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical electricity demand records with time-based features such as:
Hour of the day
Day of the week
Week of the year
Quarter
Weekend indicator
Target variable: Electricity Demand
The data is suitable for supervised regression analysis.
